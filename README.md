# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project examines data from various Kickstarter campaigns to determine how varous criteria contribute to a successful campaign. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help a kickstart campaign manager determine which approximate fundraising goal and which time of year to launch a campaign produces the most successful campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis for this project consists of two investigations:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This analysis examined the outcomes of campaigns as they relate to the date the campaigns was launched. A large sample of campaigns for play productions over a course of several years was filtered to display which months yielded the highest percentage of successful campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This analysis examined the outcome of campaigns as they relate to different groupings of fundraising targets.Various campaign targets were divided into groups to look at which range of fundraising goals produced the highest percentage of successful campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges that were encountered were ensuring that the charts were formatted to filter the correct data, mainly the month of the launch date as that had to be extracted from the date in the worksheet and to further distill the outcomes of campaigns related to theater down to only the plays. These challenges were overcome by ungrouping the data and created separate data points for those criteria.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The first conclusion that one can draw from this analysis is that the best month in which to start a campaign is either May or June as they yielded the highest percentage of successful campaigns. The second conclusion is that the worst month in which to start a campaign is December as is yielded the lowest percentage of successful campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From this analysis, one can conclude that campaigns with a goal of under $5000 yield the best results as they are responsible for the highest percentage of successful campaigns. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation of this dataset is the relativley small sample size of the campaigns with higher targets. With such a small dataset, it is difficult to determine if the results accurately reflect the typical campaigns of this size. Another limitation, which is closely tied to the first, is narrowing the search to just "plays" which contributes to the smaller sample size since the effect of the size of the goals and as well as the date of launch might not be limited to just campaigns for plays.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other possible tables and/or charts we could create are ones that examine the results of the duration of a campaigns for plays or one that looked at the number of backers a campaign had.
